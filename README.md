# Portfolio Build using HTML and CSS

## Description

A portfolio is necessary for any programmer who wishes to showcase their coding skills to the public, especialy potential employers. Such a portfolio will allow the programmer to provide an attractive landing page where they can include any details they find important for a potential employer to know. In addition to providing links to their most impressive work, they can provide more human details about themself and show off their design skills as well.

I created a portfolio using the HTML and CSS skills I have learned so far to build a framework for the work I have done so far, and for any noteworthy future projects I execute.
